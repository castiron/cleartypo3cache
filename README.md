# Clear TYPO3 Cache via CLI

Blasts your TYPO3 caches away, for that fresh, clean feeling! :sweat_drops:

* Install extension
* Create backend user `_cli_cleartypo3cache`
* Run via the command line like so: `[WEB_ROOT]/typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh cleartypo3cache all`

Adapted from relatively un-maintained extension of the same name, originally created by AOE Media.
